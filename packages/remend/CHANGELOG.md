## 1.4.3

### Patch Changes

- 95bbc61: Stop the incomplete-HTML-tag handler from truncating math expressions.

  `handleIncompleteHtmlTag` guarded against code blocks but not math, so an ordinary
  comparison inside math — `$$ I = \sum_{j<k} p_j $$` — matched the incomplete-tag
  pattern and deleted everything from the `<` to the end of the string. The trailing
  `$$` was then auto-closed by the katex handler, so KaTeX rendered a parse error and
  the rest of the message never reached the DOM.

  The handler now skips candidates inside math blocks (`$`, `$$`, `\(`, `\[`), matching
  the guard the emphasis handlers already had. Because the pattern is leftmost-matching,
  it also walks forward to later candidates instead of bailing out, so a genuine
  incomplete tag after a math expression is still stripped.

  Ported from vercel/streamdown#617 by @torsello.

## 1.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 4c0ea94: Preserve complete italic emphasis when a closing asterisk is followed by word text.

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- f6e7b94: Fix crash on iOS 16.0-16.2 / Safari < 16.3 by compiling lookbehind regexes only after a one-time constructor probe (#519). Engines that support lookbehind keep the native pattern; older JSCore falls back to a consuming capture. `remark-gfm` now resolves to `@lofcz/remark-gfm`, which pulls in the lookbehind-safe autolink-literal fork.
- 1ee2732: Preserve complete italic emphasis when a closing asterisk is followed by word text.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 219edd2: Rework code-region detection and double-underscore counting.

  A shared single-pass scanner now classifies fences and inline code spans, replacing the per-character rescans that made healing quadratic on delimiter-heavy input. Fence and span detection follows CommonMark, so `~~~` fences, list-indented fences, CRLF line endings, and multi-backtick spans are all recognized, and content inside code is never healed as prose.

  Double underscores are counted per maximal run with flanking rules, so identifiers containing `__` (like `snake__case`) no longer invent or swallow emphasis closers.

  Healing is now idempotent. Healed output re-heals to itself, including the incomplete-image placeholder (this fork keeps replacing incomplete images with a placeholder rather than removing them) and any whitespace that precedes it.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 5c920c5: Incomplete images during streaming now render a loading placeholder instead of being removed entirely. Incomplete images (e.g. `![alt](https://exampl`) are replaced with `![alt](streamdown:incomplete-image)` by remend, and the streamdown `ImageComponent` renders an animated skeleton for this special URL. This mirrors the existing behavior for incomplete links (`streamdown:incomplete-link`).
- 4ac4beb: Treat LaTeX paren and bracket math as protected math contexts during emphasis completion.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e50b0c4: Add opt-in inline KaTeX completion (`$formula` → `$formula$`) via a new `inlineKatex` option that defaults to `false` to avoid ambiguity with currency symbols. Also fixes block KaTeX completion when streaming produces a partial closing `$`.
- 716a5f0: Escape single `~` between word characters to prevent false strikethrough rendering (e.g. `20~25°C` no longer renders as strikethrough). Adds a new `singleTilde` option (enabled by default) that can be disabled via `{ singleTilde: false }`.

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- a725579: Fix emphasis completion handlers incorrectly closing bold/italic/strikethrough markers that appear inside complete inline code spans (e.g. `` `**bold` `` no longer gets a stray `**` appended outside the backticks).
