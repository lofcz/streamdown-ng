## 2.16.1

### Patch Changes

- 4d1d442: Accept animation effect objects in `animated.animation`.

  An `AnimationEffect` bundles a keyframes name with the per-word behavior those keyframes need:

  ```ts
  interface AnimationEffect {
    name: string; // @keyframes sd-<name>
    duration?: number; // default; animated.duration overrides it
    scatter?: number; // max extra delay per word, hashed from its position
    decorate?: (text: string, seed: number) => Record<`data-${string}`, string>;
  }
  ```

  `scatter` reveals words in a stable random order instead of left to right. `decorate` adds `data-*` attributes to each word while it animates, for effect styles to use. Other attributes are dropped. String animation names work as before.

- 4d1d442: Add a `smooth` prop to pace streams that arrive in large chunks.

  Some providers and relays deliver text in bursts, such as ~150 characters every ~500 ms, which renders as a jump followed by a pause. With `smooth`, Streamdown measures the time between arrivals and reveals each chunk a word at a time, so it finishes about when the next chunk is expected.

  ```tsx
  <Streamdown smooth isAnimating={status === "streaming"}>
    {markdown}
  </Streamdown>
  ```

  - Off by default. When off, rendering is unchanged.
  - Only appends are paced. Resets, edits and full-text replacements render immediately, as does content present on mount.
  - A word split across chunks is held until it's complete.
  - With `animated`, `stagger` defaults to `0`, since pacing already spaces words out. An explicit `stagger` still applies.
  - When `isAnimating` becomes `false`, the remaining text appears within 250 ms. Until then, caret, animation and incomplete-Markdown handling stay active, even if `mode` switches to `"static"` in the same update.
  - Hidden tabs render immediately, since browsers pause animation frames there.

- 4d1d442: Preserve pending and active word animations across streaming updates instead of setting their duration to zero before they finish. Apply the same timing to list markers, task checkboxes, images, and horizontal rules.

  Allow finite text animations to finish after streaming stops before removing their wrappers. Cleanup follows browser animation completion, including cancellation, rather than using a fixed timeout.

  Discard animation history for removed blocks and reset the timeline when content is cleared, so the first words of a replay animate again instead of appearing instantly.

  Exclude parser-generated layout whitespace from animation offsets so new words inside lists receive their fade and tight-to-loose list transitions preserve existing text history. Source whitespace remains counted.

  Animate fenced code as one unit on the shared timeline, preserving its fade while code and syntax highlighting update.

  Use one timestamp per render pass when scheduling blocks, so parsing time cannot let later blocks overtake earlier text.

## 2.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 5f3e66c: Add `fallbackComponent` for HTML tags and `allowedTags` entries that have no matching key in `components`. Built-in and explicit component entries still win.

### Patch Changes

- 5f3e66c: Escape `&`, `<`, and `>` in Markdown table exports so literal HTML and character entities survive copy/download and re-render.

## 2.15.3

### Patch Changes

- ec0075c: Re-issue the 2.15.2 release: its registry metadata published but the tarball blob never materialized (persistent 404), so this version re-ships the same content under a new number.

## 2.15.2

### Patch Changes

- 163c63b: fix(code-block): use absolute positioning for action buttons to fix click events in nested scroll containers

  Switches the code block action button wrapper from `position: sticky` to
  `position: absolute` (with `position: relative` on the container) so that
  hit-testing works correctly in layouts with multiple nested `overflow: auto`
  scroll containers. Previously, the `sticky` + `pointer-events-none/auto`
  pattern caused browsers to mis-route click events to the code block wrapper
  rather than the buttons when the component was embedded in 2+ nested scroll
  containers.

- c780970: Stop treating a number right after a list marker (`- 23. října`, `1. 23) foo`) as a nested ordered list. Per CommonMark it is one, but in streamed prose it is a date or a count, so the marker is folded back into the item text when the nested list is inline and has a single item. Deliberate nested lists on their own indented lines are unchanged.
- fdf4e33: Fix Mermaid diagrams so text is readable and diagrams auto-fit container.
  - Normalize SVG to remove responsive shrinking
  - Extract intrinsic size from viewBox
  - Add width-and-height auto-fit in PanZoom
  - Preserve user zoom/pan after initial fit
  - Add tests for SVG utilities and auto-fit behavior

## 2.15.1

### Patch Changes

- f564f15: Wait to parse Vega and SMILES until the fence closes, and add a SMILES toolbar toggle between skeletal structures and SmilesDrawer compact notation (CH₃ / COOH).

## 2.15.0

### Minor Changes

- ed88b73: Add a first-class SMILES chemical structure plugin. Fenced `smiles` / `smi` blocks render through `@lofcz/streamdown-smiles` (SmilesDrawer) on the shared SVG diagram path, with the same download, fullscreen, and pan/zoom controls as Mermaid, PlantUML, and Vega.

  SMILES follows the OpenSCAD engine-injection pattern: `createSmilesPlugin({ engine })` plus a separate `./engine` entry so `smiles-drawer` stays out of the bundler graph until the engine is imported.

- ed88b73: Add a generic SVG diagram plugin path and first-class Vega / Vega-Lite charts. Mermaid and PlantUML now share one renderer, controls, and download/fullscreen UI; extra engines can be registered via `plugins.diagrams`. Fenced `vega` / `vega-lite` / `vegalite` blocks render through `@lofcz/streamdown-vega`.

  Vega and PlantUML now follow the OpenSCAD engine-injection pattern: `createXPlugin({ engine })` plus a separate `./engine` entry so `vega` / `vega-lite` and `@plantuml/core` stay out of the bundler graph until the engine is imported.

### Patch Changes

- d3e20f7: Keep literal data tags out of multiline Markdown-container preprocessing so encoded punctuation next to URLs remains literal text.

## 2.14.1

### Patch Changes

- 727755b: Block React keys now track blocks by content instead of index. Index keys kept DOM nodes alive across token appends but rewrote every block below a head insert/remove in place (new content into old slots), destroying inner DOM identity — which breaks consumer scroll anchoring, selection and animation state on structural edits. Keys are now assigned at block birth and followed across positions (unchanged, streamed-append and moved blocks keep their key; genuinely new or rewritten content gets a fresh key), so nodes below a head edit are moved, not rewritten.

## 2.14.0

### Minor Changes

- efa1f5e: Wire `{ onCopy, onError }` copy callbacks through every default-rendered copy control, including tables, PlantUML, and OpenSCAD.

  `controls.table.copy` can now be `{ onCopy, onError }` in addition to a boolean. Table `onCopy` receives the chosen format (`"csv" | "tsv" | "md"`). Diagram and model copy buttons already accepted the same object shape as `controls.code.copy`.

- 7f71155: Allow `controls.code.copy`, `controls.mermaid.copy`, `controls.plantuml.copy`, and `controls.openscad.copy` to be `{ onCopy, onError }` so default-rendered copy buttons can report success and clipboard failures.

  ```tsx
  <Streamdown
    controls={{
      code: {
        copy: {
          onCopy: () => announce("Copied"),
          onError: (error) => toast.error(error.message),
        },
      },
    }}
  >
    {markdown}
  </Streamdown>
  ```

  Boolean `copy` values still work. Closes vercel/streamdown#557.

- 7f71155: Add a `disableAutolinkProtocols` prop to `<Streamdown>` for disabling GFM autolinking of specific URL protocols (e.g. `mailto`).

  ```tsx
  <Streamdown disableAutolinkProtocols={["mailto"]}>
    {"Contact us at hello@example.com"}
  </Streamdown>
  ```

  Bare emails and bare URLs whose protocol matches the list (case-insensitive, `"mailto"` and `"mailto:"` are equivalent) are unwrapped back to plain text. Explicit markdown links (`[text](mailto:...)`) are left as links. When the prop is omitted, autolinking behavior is completely unchanged.

  Closes vercel/streamdown#607.

- 3b713da: Localize remaining interactive UI: Mermaid/PlantUML/OpenSCAD copy labels and chart `aria-label`s, plus matching `aria-label`s on table, image, and link-modal controls. `useTranslations` is now exported.

### Patch Changes

- db08f80: Fix TypeScript conflict between custom copy/download `onError` callbacks and the native button `onError` / `onCopy` event types so the package builds.
- 0ab2dbc: Speed up block parsing by lexing only block tokens, and settle streamed prefix blocks only after a blank-line boundary that cannot still change (`#x`, `2.`, setext underlines).

## 2.13.3

### Patch Changes

- 16dc6cd: Custom-tag preprocessing (`allowedTags`, `literalTagContent`) now ignores tags that appear inside fenced code blocks and inline code spans. Previously a model _explaining_ its own tag syntax — e.g. `` `<law>` `` in prose followed later by a real `</law>` — had the bare code-span tag hijacked as an opener: everything up to the next close tag was markdown-escaped and collapsed into a single raw-text element, and multi-line bodies got blank-line/`<!---->` placeholders injected into the surrounding prose. Tags shown in code are now left verbatim, a close tag inside a nested fence no longer terminates a container early, and real pairs after a code-span mention are still processed.

## 2.13.2

### Patch Changes

- f02746c: OpenSCAD: never render while the fence is still streaming — partial code is invalid until the fence closes and every attempt costs a fresh wasm instantiation, so the renderer now waits on block completeness and shows a light placeholder. Also localize the Mermaid/PlantUML/OpenSCAD renderer strings (loading, error labels, "Show Code", plugin-missing, render-failed, writing placeholder) through the existing `translations` prop.

## 2.13.1

### Patch Changes

- 34e24e1: Add the OpenSCAD viewer's default `h-[400px]` to the Tailwind source class list so consumer apps generate the utility (the viewer container would otherwise collapse to zero height).

## 2.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 83936c3: Add first-class OpenSCAD models. Fenced `openscad` / `scad` blocks render via `@lofcz/streamdown-openscad`, which lazy-loads the `@lofcz/openscad-wasm` engine (bundler graph only — the engine entry is a separate import so apps that don't use it never pull the ~11MB wasm) and displays the result with an interactive three.js viewer in its own lazy chunk. Format auto-selection keeps `color()` models as 3MF and everything else as binary STL; font/MCAD bundles load only when the source uses `text()` / MCAD includes. Controls (copy, download SCAD/STL/3MF, fullscreen) match PlantUML.

### Patch Changes

- Fix block splitting under marked v18: fold standalone `space` tokens into the previous block so block boundaries and counts stay identical to v17 behavior. Ported from upstream vercel/streamdown#603 (the fork already shipped marked v18, shiki v4, and the incomplete-image placeholder, so only this parsing fix is new here).
- 8b1383f: Fix Mermaid diagrams so text is readable and diagrams auto-fit container.
  - Normalize SVG to remove responsive shrinking
  - Extract intrinsic size from viewBox
  - Add width-and-height auto-fit in PanZoom
  - Preserve user zoom/pan after initial fit
  - Add tests for SVG utilities and auto-fit behavior

## 2.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 9889a5b: Add first-class PlantUML diagrams. Fenced `plantuml` / `puml` blocks render via `@lofcz/streamdown-plantuml`, which lazy-loads the official `@plantuml/core` TeaVM engine. Controls (copy, download SVG/PNG/PUML, fullscreen, pan-zoom) match Mermaid.

## 2.11.2

### Patch Changes

- be438f5: fix(table): wrap and clamp overflowing headers with a hover title

  `table-fixed` plus `whitespace-nowrap` let long header labels paint over neighboring cells. Headers now wrap (breaking long words), clamp to two lines with an ellipsis, and expose the full label via the native `title` tooltip.

## 2.11.1

### Patch Changes

- 18dcb20: Add a top-level `portal` prop for configuring the container used by Mermaid fullscreen, table fullscreen, and the built-in link safety modal.

## 2.11.0

### Minor Changes

- b734cbf: - Add custom download filenames for code, table, and mermaid via the `controls` prop
  - Configure downloads with `download: { filename: "customName" }` while keeping boolean `true`/`false` to show or hide
  - Preserve automatic file-extension mapping based on language or export format
  - Remove the `codeDownload` prop in favor of the unified `controls` API
- 4436b56: - Add `controls.table.csvSeparator` (`"," | ";" | "\t" | "auto"`) for table copy and download CSV
  - Reuse `tableDataToCSV` separator handling, including locale-aware `"auto"` mode
  - Improve CSV escaping to respect the selected separator for Excel compatibility

### Patch Changes

- 6ec3c48: fix(animate): animate inline code during streaming

  Skip the animate visitor on `pre` (and svg/math/annotation) only — not bare `code`. Fenced/highlighted blocks stay un-split via their `pre` ancestor; inline backtick spans now get the same per-word fade-in as surrounding prose.

  Fixes #594

## 2.10.5

### Patch Changes

- 2ed2faa: Allow remend's `streamdown:` incomplete-link sentinel through the default sanitize schema so streamed incomplete links render as pending instead of harden `[blocked]`.

## 2.10.4

### Patch Changes

- 49d3d5c: feat(mermaid): deterministic label auto-fix before surfacing render errors

  LLMs routinely emit Mermaid labels containing characters the lexer treats as
  syntax (`{ get; set; }` in a mindmap node, `Process (main)` in a flowchart
  label). When a chart fails to render, the Mermaid component now runs a
  deterministic repair pass — quoting broken mindmap/flowchart labels with
  `"…"`/`#quot;` per verified mermaid@11 parse rules — and renders the fixed
  source when it succeeds. Unfixable charts rethrow the original error, so the
  custom `errorComponent` fallback behaviour is unchanged.

## 2.10.3

### Patch Changes

- 1faabc1: fix(code): auto-scroll streamed code with snap-to-bottom latching

  Code blocks never re-pinned as tokens arrived (`result` was missing from
  the scroll effect), and custom `scrollable` viewports assigned after paint
  (e.g. OverlayScrollbars) were ignored. Shared `usePinnedScroll` now uses a
  callback ref, re-pins on content/resize while latched, detaches on wheel/touch
  up, and re-latches when the user scrolls back to the bottom.

## 2.10.2

### Patch Changes

- 4c0ea94: fix(custom-tags): render Markdown inside custom tags with multiline content

  Adds a blank-line sandwich in preprocessCustomTags so nested markdown
  parses inside custom tags. Tags listed in `literalTagContent` are excluded
  from re-parsing. Hyphenated tags are tracked across blank-line interruptions.

  Closes vercel/streamdown#478

## 2.10.1

### Patch Changes

- 09f0bc2: Forward rest props through block code. The `code` component spread its rest props on the inline branch and dropped them on the block branch, so an attribute a consumer put on a fenced code element never reached the DOM. `CodeBlockBody` now takes part in that comparison, so a forwarded attribute updates instead of keeping the value it first rendered with.
- 245eac4: Fix `dir="auto"` in static mode to detect text direction per semantic block (instead of once for the whole document), keep code LTR, and use content-majority direction for mixed-script prose.
- 316eed8: Added accessibility improvements for code block controls by adding aria labels to copy/download buttons and announcing copy success state for screen readers.
- 4e41f93: fix(animate): serialize streaming animation across blocks

  Word stagger now runs on a shared wall-clock timeline so sibling sections no longer fade in on top of each other during streaming. Related cleanup: trailing spaces stay inside animated spans (no early link underlines), animate wrappers drop when streaming ends, already-seen text stays steady under StrictMode, and un-animated streaming is no longer deferred behind a starvable transition.

  Inspired by #493, #531, and #536.

  Fixes #482
  Fixes #535
  Fixes #550
  Fixes #570

- 17b5ed8: Add `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative SVG icon components so screen readers rely on parent button labels instead of unlabeled icons.
- f6e7b94: Fix crash on iOS 16.0-16.2 / Safari < 16.3 by compiling lookbehind regexes only after a one-time constructor probe (#519). Engines that support lookbehind keep the native pattern; older JSCore falls back to a consuming capture. `remark-gfm` now resolves to `@lofcz/remark-gfm`, which pulls in the lookbehind-safe autolink-literal fork.
- 8798fd0: fix(mermaid): add aria-hidden to decorative SVG icons in mermaid toolbar buttons

  Mermaid toolbar buttons (download, fullscreen, pan/zoom controls) already have
  accessible titles/labels, but the inline SVG icons were exposed to the accessibility
  tree causing "Content with images must be labeled" warnings. Added aria-hidden={true}
  to all decorative icon elements in download-button, fullscreen-button, and pan-zoom
  components.

  Fixes #485

- b200263: Fix: `shikiTheme` prop priority chain is now fully reachable.

  Previously, `shikiTheme` had a default value in the props destructuring (`= defaultShikiTheme`), making the `plugins?.code?.getThemes()` fallback unreachable in both orderings. The fix removes the destructuring default and moves it to the end of the nullish coalescing chain, so all three levels are reachable:

  1. Explicit `shikiTheme` prop (highest priority)
  2. Code plugin's `getThemes()` (second priority)
  3. Built-in `defaultShikiTheme` (final fallback)

- b0e4745: Fix accessibility warnings for Mermaid toolbar icon buttons:

  - Add `aria-hidden="true"` to all decorative SVG icons to hide them from screen readers
  - Add `aria-label` attributes to all icon-only buttons for proper screen reader announcements
  - Add translation keys (`zoomIn`, `zoomOut`, `resetView`) for zoom controls

- 9cf31dc: Re-render memoized markdown components when their rendered output changes. The comparators compared source position, so a replacement of the same length — occupying the same lines and columns — was treated as unchanged and the component kept rendering the previous text.
- c71ddf3: - Fixed table copy losing line breaks inside cells containing `<br>` elements.
  - Preserved multiline content during table data extraction.
  - Improved copied Markdown, CSV, and TSV output consistency for multiline cells.
  - Added coverage for `<br>` handling in table extraction.
- 1f9ae1c: - Fix code block line wrapping when line numbers are disabled.
  - Ensure code block lines are rendered as block elements regardless of the `lineNumbers` setting.
  - Prevent multiple code lines from collapsing into a single visual line when `lineNumbers={false}`.

## 2.10.0

### Minor Changes

- Add declarative `dataOnlyTags` prop: custom tags whose parsed children are lifted into a JSON `data-content` attribute and removed from the rendered tree. This enables payload-style custom tags (e.g. a `<suggestions>` list in AI chat output) where the mapped `components` entry renders arbitrary UI from structured data instead of the raw markup. Pairs with the existing `allowedTags` / `literalTagContent` seams.

### Patch Changes

- ee72640: Fix type declarations requiring a `shiki` install.

  `BundledLanguage`, `BundledTheme`, and `ThemeRegistrationAny` are now defined locally and re-exported from `streamdown`, so consumers can type-check without installing `shiki`. Runtime highlighting remains in `@streamdown/code`, which still depends on `shiki`. Method syntax on `CodeHighlighterPlugin` keeps narrower Shiki plugin types assignable.

## 2.9.3

### Patch Changes

- d88bc69: Fix Shiki code-block token colors when Tailwind `@source inline` drops comma-containing utilities

## 2.9.2

### Patch Changes

- 7d0b01b: Suppress the streaming caret after a code block or table from `styles.css` instead of from the container's class list. The container's className and inline style no longer change as blocks stream in, which removes the whole-document style recalculation that each change triggered.

## 2.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 2ee6f2a: GFM task lists: stop rendering a stray bullet marker before the checkbox, lay the checkbox and label out on one line with proper spacing (`flex items-center gap-2`, compact `my-1`), and keep regular unordered items bulleted.
- 2ee6f2a: GFM alerts: render the warning icon as an outlined triangle (split evenodd path instead of a solid fill) and give every alert icon `fill="currentColor"` so it matches its per-kind title color.

## 2.9.0

### Minor Changes

- f50bf5d: GFM alerts: render octicons as inline SVG (fix sanitize stripping `d`/`width`/`height`/`aria-hidden` so icons no longer need octicon CSS), apply per-kind colored border/background/title accents, and localize the alert title (Note/Tip/Important/Warning/Caution) via the `translations` prop.

## 2.8.1

### Patch Changes

- cc382bc: Align GFM alerts with GitHub / `rehype-github-alerts` rendering.

  - Title is now a `<p class="markdown-alert-title">` containing a Primer octicon `<svg>` and the capitalized kind name (`Note`, `Tip`, …) instead of a bare `<div>` with lowercase text
  - Any text after the marker on the first line (e.g. `> [!NOTE] extra`) now renders as a plain blockquote, matching GitHub (removes the incorrect "custom title" behavior)
  - An alert marker with no body (`> [!NOTE]` alone) stays a plain blockquote
  - Nested blockquotes inside an alert are no longer transformed into alerts
  - Updated sanitize schema (allow `svg`/`path`, title class on `<p>`) so the title and icon survive `rehype-sanitize`, fixing the empty-title bug

## 2.8.0

### Minor Changes

- f98bfd0: Add `listStyle` prop for hierarchical bullet styling in nested lists.

  - New `listStyle` prop accepts `"flat"` or `"hierarchical"` (default: `"hierarchical"`)
  - Hierarchical mode cycles bullet styles through disc → circle → square based on nesting depth
  - Flat mode preserves the previous uniform `list-disc` behavior
  - All list elements (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) now receive a `data-depth` attribute for custom CSS targeting

## 2.7.4

### Patch Changes

- 6e1b81c: Fix KaTeX display math clipping for LLM-style single-line `$$...$$` equations. Sanitize now preserves remark-math's `math-display` / `math-inline` class markers (hast-util-sanitize does not OR multiple className allowlist entries, so a single regex is required). `@lofcz/streamdown-math` promotes lone-paragraph inline math to flow math and bumps `katex` to ^0.18.1 so HTML class names match current KaTeX CSS (`katex-sizing`).

## 2.7.3

### Patch Changes

- 4385e51: Fix custom self-closing tags (e.g. `<vfs-cite ... />`) dropping all following text. `preprocessCustomTags` now rewrites self-closing custom tags to explicit open+close pairs before parsing, because rehype-raw's hast parser treats unknown tags as non-void containers and swallows trailing inline content as children. Also guard the block-splitter against pushing a self-closing custom tag onto the HTML block stack, which previously merged all following blocks into a never-closed HTML block.

## 2.7.2

### Patch Changes

- 3d76bee: Point `streamdown/tailwind` subpath export at `dist/lib/tailwind-classes.js` where tsup actually emits the entry, fixing module resolution for consumers using Tailwind v4 `prefix()`.

## 2.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 772ba07: Fix `streamdown/tailwind` subpath export: tsup emits the entry at `dist/lib/tailwind-classes.js`, but `package.json` pointed at `dist/tailwind-classes.js`, so the subpath failed to resolve after install.

## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 297e729: Fix word splitting logic to correctly merge whitespace with preceding tokens in animation pipeline
- 19a1735: Add codeBlockMaxHeight and tableMaxHeight props with streaming auto-scroll
- eaed605: Fix table copy and download actions not working in fullscreen mode.

  - Support table lookup inside the fullscreen portal container.
  - Restore copy and download functionality for fullscreen tables.
  - Keep existing inline table controls behavior unchanged.

- f965e2d: Fix Mermaid diagrams so text is readable and diagrams auto-fit container.
  - Normalize SVG to remove responsive shrinking
  - Extract intrinsic size from viewBox
  - Add width-and-height auto-fit in PanZoom
  - Preserve user zoom/pan after initial fit
  - Add tests for SVG utilities and auto-fit behavior

### Patch Changes

- a36b1eb: Serialize Mermaid SVGs before download so HTML-style tags render as valid SVG markup.
- 113352e: Fix stale rendering when in-block markdown content changes during streaming updates.
- b02b578: fix(animate): serialize stagger delays across sibling blocks to prevent concurrent animation

  Previously all blocks shared a single animate plugin instance and a fixed
  `startIndex` of 0, so when a new block appeared during streaming its words
  began animating at delay 0 while the preceding block's words were still
  animating — resulting in multiple sections revealing concurrently.

  This change introduces an `AnimateCursor` — a small shared counter object
  that resets to 0 at the start of each React render pass. Each block now gets
  its own `AnimatePlugin` instance; the plugin reads the cursor for its start
  index, animates its words, and advances the cursor by its word count. Sibling
  blocks automatically chain after one another without any manual wiring.

  Fixes #482

- aee5c2a: Fix React #185 (`Maximum update depth exceeded`) cascade under rapid streaming token bursts.

  Replaces the internal `useState` + `useEffect`-to-sync + manual `startTransition`
  dance that mirrored `blocks` into `displayBlocks` with `useDeferredValue`. The
  previous pattern fired `setDisplayBlocks(blocks)` on every render where `blocks`
  was a new reference; under SSE bursts that delivered tokens faster than React
  committed, those setStates stacked inside one commit cycle and exceeded React's
  50-nested-update limit. `useDeferredValue` performs the same semantic role
  (low-priority blocks-state update during streaming) without producing setStates
  that can cascade.

  No behavior change: SSR/hydration still initializes with the current `blocks`,
  `animatePlugin` path still uses synchronous (non-deferred) blocks, all 982
  existing tests pass.

  Closes the cluster of issues tracked in #140; addresses the React #185 reports
  in downstream consumers when `experimental_throttle` alone is insufficient.

- ca65766: fix(custom-tags): render Markdown inside custom tags with multiline content

  Adds a new rehype plugin (rehypeMarkdownInCustomTags) that re-parses raw text
  content of custom tag elements as Markdown. Previously, when a custom tag
  contained multiline content (e.g. `<ai-thinking>
**bold**</ai-thinking>`),
  CommonMark treated the block as raw HTML, stripping Markdown formatting.
  Tags listed in `literalTagContent` are excluded from re-parsing.

  Closes #478

- 6743857: Fix doubled `user-content-` prefix on footnote ids

  Footnote list items were rendered with `id="user-content-user-content-fn-1"` because both `remark-rehype` and `rehype-sanitize` default their `clobberPrefix` to `user-content-`, so the prefix was applied twice. Disabled `clobberPrefix` on `rehype-sanitize` so `remark-rehype` remains the single, consistent prefixer of both footnote ids and backref hrefs — restoring working footnote navigation.

- 44cc2d2: Render the link safety modal through a portal to `document.body` so it is no longer nested inside the paragraph's `<p>` element. This fixes the React hydration error "In HTML, `<div>` cannot be a descendant of `<p>`" that occurred when a link with link safety enabled appeared inside a paragraph.
- 39a623a: fix(mermaid): add data-streamdown, aria-modal, and correct role to fullscreen overlay

  The Mermaid fullscreen overlay was missing the `data-streamdown="mermaid-fullscreen"` attribute and using `role="button"` instead of `role="dialog"`, and was missing `aria-modal="true"`. This matches the table fullscreen overlay pattern and enables stable CSS targeting and correct accessibility semantics.

- cb2c35c: fix(deps): remove `mermaid` as a hard runtime dependency

  `mermaid` was listed in `dependencies` but the core `streamdown` package
  only imports it as a type (`import type { MermaidConfig }`). The actual
  mermaid runtime is exclusively used by the optional `@streamdown/mermaid`
  plugin — pulling ~75 MB into every install unnecessarily.

  This patch replaces the type import with a local structural type for
  `MermaidConfig` so no type-level coupling to the `mermaid` package remains
  in the distributed typings. Users who want fully-typed mermaid config can
  still `import type { MermaidConfig } from 'mermaid'` themselves; the
  structural type is compatible.

  Fixes #501

- 50a47cb: fix(tailwind): export STREAMDOWN_CLASSES and getSourceInline() for Tailwind v4 prefix support

  When using Tailwind v4's `prefix()` option, the Tailwind scanner cannot match
  unprefixed class names in streamdown's dist files to the prefixed utilities it
  generates (e.g. it looks for `tw:flex` but dist files only contain `flex`).

  This patch adds a new `streamdown/tailwind` entry point that exports:

  - `STREAMDOWN_CLASSES` – a readonly array of every Tailwind utility class used
    by streamdown and its official plugins
  - `getSourceInline(prefix?)` – returns a ready-to-paste Tailwind v4
    `@source inline(...)` directive with all classes, optionally prefixed

  Users can now generate the correct `@source inline()` directive for their
  prefix and add it to their CSS file.

- de94930: Fix table column widths from shifting during streaming by applying a fixed table layout to standard and fullscreen tables.
- 7be41e8: fix issue with list markers, task-list checkboxes, images, and hr animations
- 5c920c5: Incomplete images during streaming now render a loading placeholder instead of being removed entirely. Incomplete images (e.g. `![alt](https://exampl`) are replaced with `![alt](streamdown:incomplete-image)` by remend, and the streamdown `ImageComponent` renders an animated skeleton for this special URL. This mirrors the existing behavior for incomplete links (`streamdown:incomplete-link`).
- baa9b12: fix(mermaid): render the download control inside the Mermaid fullscreen portal so it's reachable when the diagram is expanded
- 44af292: Remend only the trailing markdown block during streaming and reuse settled block parses incrementally, avoiding full-document remend churn on every token.

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- deedae0: Fix markdown image chrome: drop prose-inflated margins and the gray hover wash, and open a fullscreen lightbox on click. Image download/fullscreen can be toggled via `controls.image`. Move `StreamdownContext` into its own module so image controls don't create a circular import with `components`.

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- d6666b6: Add `lineNumbers` prop to disable line numbers in code blocks
- d4ec6c0: Add `meta` prop to `CustomRendererProps`. Custom renderers now receive the raw metastring from the code fence (everything after the language identifier, e.g. ` ```rust {1} title="foo" ` → `meta = '{1} title="foo"'`). The prop is optional (`meta?: string`) and is `undefined` when no metastring is present. Existing custom renderers are unaffected.

### Patch Changes

- ac8d839: Add staggered `animation-delay` to streaming word/character animations so new content cascades in sequentially instead of all animating simultaneously. Configurable via the new `stagger` option (default 40ms). Set `stagger: 0` to restore the previous behavior.
- add5374: Enable horizontal scrolling on code blocks so long lines are accessible instead of being clipped by `overflow-hidden`.
- 75845c0: Fix unnecessary re-renders of code blocks during streaming updates.

  **Problem:** In streaming mode, when new content arrives (e.g. a paragraph is appended), completed code blocks that haven't changed were still re-rendering. This happened because the `Streamdown` component used inline object literals as default parameter values for `linkSafety` (`{ enabled: true }`). Every time `children` changed and `Streamdown` re-rendered, these inline defaults created new references, which caused the `contextValue` useMemo to recompute a new `StreamdownContext` object. Since React propagates context changes through `memo` boundaries, any context consumer inside a memoized `Block` (such as `CodeBlock`) would re-render even though the block's own props were unchanged.

  **Fix:** Extract the inline default values for `linkSafety` into module-level constants (`defaultLinkSafetyConfig`). This ensures referential stability across renders, so `contextValue` only recomputes when the actual values change — not just because `children` updated.

- 8b1c262: fix: prepend UTF-8 BOM to CSV downloads for Excel compatibility

  - `save()` now prepends `\uFEFF` for `text/csv` string content so Excel on
    Windows detects UTF-8 encoding instead of falling back to ANSI.
  - `TableDownloadButton` refactored to use `save()` instead of inline Blob
    creation, ensuring the public API also gets the BOM fix.

- b105c64: Fix custom tag content being prematurely split when content follows the opening tag on the same line and contains double newlines (`\n\n`). The preprocessor now ensures proper HTML block structure so the parser treats the entire tag as a single unit.
- 9e6f991: Increase dropdown z-index for table copy and download menus to prevent clipping by surrounding elements.
- 9c18748: docs: document required CSS custom properties (shadcn/ui design tokens) in README
- 7b62e9a: Replace Tailwind v4-only `*:last:` and `*:first:` variant syntax with `[&>*:last-child]:` and `[&>*:first-child]:` arbitrary variants for compatibility with both Tailwind CSS v3 and v4. Fixes caret rendering on every line instead of only the last child in v3.
- Updated dependencies [e50b0c4]
- Updated dependencies [716a5f0]
  - remend@1.3.0

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 5edff75: Clarified Tailwind `@source` configuration for Streamdown and optional plugins.
  Updated documentation to keep the global `@source` for core `streamdown` only, move plugin `@source` guidance to plugin docs with examples, and add a caveat to include plugin entries only if installed.
- 57cd3b5: Add support for custom starting line numbers in code blocks via the `startLine` meta option.

  Code blocks can now specify a starting line number in the meta string:

  ````md
  ```js startLine=10
  const x = 1;
  ```
  ````

  This renders line numbers beginning at 10 instead of the default 1. The feature works by parsing the `startLine=N` value from the fenced-code meta string and applying `counter-reset: line N-1` to the `<code>` element.

- 57cd3b5: Add support for customizing icons via the `icons` prop on `<Streamdown>`.

  Users can override any subset of the built-in icons (copy, download, zoom, etc.) by passing a `Partial<IconMap>`:

  ```tsx
  import { Streamdown, type IconMap } from "streamdown";

  <Streamdown icons={{ CheckIcon: MyCheckIcon }}>{content}</Streamdown>;
  ```

  Unspecified icons fall back to defaults.

- 01d27e9: Add support for custom Shiki themes via a `themes` option on `createCodePlugin`, accepting a `[light, dark]` pair of bundled theme names or full theme registration objects.
- 2cf559d: Add a virtual `inlineCode` key to the `components` prop, allowing inline code spans to be styled independently from fenced code blocks without manually detecting block vs. inline context.
- 27c7b03: Export table action components (`TableCopyDropdown`, `TableDownloadButton`, `TableDownloadDropdown`) and utilities (`extractTableDataFromElement`, `tableDataToCSV`, `tableDataToTSV`, `tableDataToMarkdown`, `escapeMarkdownTableCell`, `TableData`), enabling custom table overrides to preserve copy/download interactivity.
- fb76275: Add a fullscreen overlay for tables with Escape/backdrop-click to close and scroll locking, controlled via `controls.table.fullscreen`. Copy and download controls remain available in the fullscreen view.
- b392fbe: Add `literalTagContent` prop that accepts an array of custom HTML tag names (e.g. `['mention']`) whose children should be treated as plain text, escaping markdown metacharacters so user-supplied labels aren't interpreted as formatting.
- c4c86fa: Add a `dir` prop that accepts `"ltr"`, `"rtl"`, or `"auto"`. When set to `"auto"`, each block's text direction is detected by scanning for the first strong Unicode character (Arabic, Hebrew, Thaana, etc.).
- 00872f0: Add a `prefix` prop that prepends a namespace to all generated Tailwind utility classes (e.g. `flex` becomes `tw:flex`), enabling Tailwind v4's `prefix()` feature for projects that need to avoid class name collisions.
- 401b901: Add support for custom renderers via `plugins.renderers`, allowing fenced code blocks with specific languages to be rendered by a custom component instead of the default `CodeBlock`.

### Patch Changes

- f398611: Add `onAnimationStart` and `onAnimationEnd` callback props that fire when streaming animation begins and completes, useful for coordinating UI state with the animation lifecycle.
- f2a7e51: Fix empty lines in syntax-highlighted code blocks collapsing into nothing by rendering a newline character for empty token rows, preserving whitespace when copying.
- 9ba8511: fix: prevent ordered list animation retrigger during streaming

  When streaming content contains multiple ordered (or unordered) lists,
  the Marked lexer merges them into a single block. As each new item appears
  the block is re-processed through the rehype pipeline, re-creating all
  `data-sd-animate` spans. This caused already-visible characters to re-run
  their CSS entry animation.

  Two changes address the root cause:

  1. **Per-block `prevContentLength` tracking** – each `Block` component
     now keeps a `useRef` with the content length from its previous render.
     Before each render the `animatePlugin.setPrevContentLength(n)` method is
     called so the rehype plugin can detect which text-node positions were
     already rendered. Characters whose cumulative hast-text offset falls below
     the previous raw-content length receive `--sd-duration:0ms`, making them
     appear in their final state instantly rather than re-animating.

  2. **Stable `animatePlugin` reference** – the `animatePlugin` `useMemo`
     now uses value-based dependency comparison instead of reference equality
     for the `animated` option object. This prevents the plugin from being
     recreated on every parent re-render when the user passes an inline object
     literal (e.g. `animated={{ animation: 'fadeIn' }}`). A stable reference
     is required because the rehype processor cache uses the function name as
     its key and always returns the first cached closure; only the original
     `config` object is ever read by the processor.

- 781178b: Add a granular `controls` prop that accepts a boolean to toggle all controls or an object with per-feature flags (`code`, `table`, `mermaid`) for fine-grained control over copy, download, fullscreen, and pan/zoom buttons.
- e129f09: Add a `translations` prop for overriding all user-facing UI strings (copy/download button labels, modal text, image alt text, etc.), enabling full i18n support.
- Updated dependencies [a725579]
  - remend@1.2.2

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 3657e42: Add `useIsCodeFenceIncomplete` hook for detecting incomplete code fences during streaming

  Custom components can now detect when the code fence in their block is still being streamed. This is useful for deferring expensive renders (syntax highlighting, Mermaid diagrams) until the code block is complete.

  ```tsx
  import { useIsCodeFenceIncomplete } from "streamdown";

  const MyCodeBlock = ({ children }) => {
    const isIncomplete = useIsCodeFenceIncomplete();

    if (isIncomplete) {
      return <div>Loading code...</div>;
    }

    return (
      <pre>
        <code>{children}</code>
      </pre>
    );
  };
  ```

  The hook returns `true` when:

  - Streaming is active (`isAnimating={true}`)
  - The component is in the last block being streamed
  - That block has an unclosed code fence

  The default code block component now uses this hook to set a `data-incomplete` attribute when incomplete, enabling CSS-based loading states.

- 32fb079: fix: hide download button on broken images and display a custom "Image not available" message instead
- d73d7bb: Make the action buttons in code block header sticky.
  Ensures copy buttons remain accessible for long code blocks.
  Improves usability when viewing large snippets.
- 15645da: Move code block lazy loading to the highlighting layer so block shells render immediately with plain text content before syntax colors resolve. This improves visual stability and removes the spinner fallback for standard code blocks.

### Patch Changes

- 0987479: fix: codeblock highlight flicker while streaming
- 5d438ca: Add support for copying table data as Markdown in TableCopyDropdown.
  Introduces a Markdown copy option alongside existing formats.
  Allows users to quickly copy tables in valid Markdown format.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c1e1e66: Bake animate into streamdown as built-in `animated` prop

### Patch Changes

- d5fe6d6: fix: properly handle HTML void elements in parse-blocks
- 6bb03ca: fix: escape HTML when rehype-raw is omitted (#330)
- a12de57: Custom tags in components
- 83f043c: Fix: certain LaTeX syntaxes e.g. \(...\) are not rendering
- aabb9ab: Fix $$ inside code blocks being treated as math delimiters

  Code blocks can contain `$$` as shell syntax (e.g., `pstree -p $$` for current process ID). The math block merging logic was incorrectly counting `$$` inside code blocks, causing subsequent content to be merged as if it were part of a math block.

  Added tracking of previous token type to skip math merging when the previous block was a code block.

- 9f72224: Fix footnote detection incorrectly matching regex character classes

  The footnote reference and definition patterns were too permissive, using `[^\]\s]` which matches any character except `]` and whitespace. This caused regex negated character classes like `[^\s...]` in code blocks to be incorrectly detected as footnotes, resulting in the entire document being returned as a single block.

  Updated the patterns to only match valid footnote identifiers (alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens) using `[\w-]` instead.

- 266fa2b: Fix word-internal underscores being incorrectly treated as incomplete markdown

  Previously, underscores used as word separators (e.g., `hello_world`, `snake_case`) were incorrectly identified as incomplete italic markdown, causing an extra underscore to be appended. This fix:

  - Detects when underscores are between word characters and treats them as literals
  - Preserves the streaming markdown completion for genuine incomplete italics (e.g., `_italic text`)
  - Correctly handles trailing newlines when completing italic formatting

  Fixes the issue where `hello_world` would become `hello_world_` when `parseIncompleteMarkdown` was enabled.
